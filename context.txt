ðŸ§¾ Project Task Overview (Prepared by Rohan)
Weâ€™re working on a Real-Time Skill Exchange Network â€” think of it like Uber for knowledge â€” where users can instantly connect with skilled individuals via video call to solve real-time problems or learn something quickly.

âœ… What Weâ€™re Doing Now
Iâ€™ve successfully cloned and set up the project locally. The codebase is clean, and weâ€™re using Next.js with Convex as the backend/database. The goal is to keep everything real-time and scalable, while ensuring the developer experience remains smooth.

Currently, weâ€™re focusing on the core messaging/chat functionality â€” which is a key piece of the platform.

ðŸ”§ My Responsibilities
Iâ€™ve taken charge of the following parts:

Convex Database Schema

Setting up tables like users, chats, messages, etc.

Making sure relationships are well structured and scalable.

Backend Functions with Convex

Writing core logic (queries/mutations) for:

Sending messages

Creating new chats

Fetching chat history

Chat App View & Functionality

Building the chat UI in Next.js

Connecting it to Convex backend

Ensuring real-time updates using Convex hooks (useQuery, useMutation)

Documentation

Iâ€™m documenting every part of what I do â€” including schema, file structure, backend logic, and how things connect â€” so that it's easy for everyone to understand and collaborate.
